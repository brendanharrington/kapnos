# Team 13 - Kapnós
## Volatile Organic Compound Test Bench Fixture
This project evaluates the efficacy of the Medtronic RapidVac™ ULPA Filter in removing hazardous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) generated during electrosurgical procedures.

### 🚀 Overview
Goal: Measure VOC concentrations (formaldehyde, ammonia, carbon monoxide) before and after filtration.

System Components: Pre- and post-filter sensor arrays using SGX electrochemical sensors, nitrogen calibration setup, 3D-printed parts, and MATLAB integration.

Outcome: Provide quantifiable filtration efficiency data and user-friendly documentation for future use.

### 🔧 Installation
